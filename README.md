Description:
•	Use a data structure like a hash table or tree (e.g., B-tree, R- tree) to store and index property data efficiently.
•	Implement search algorithms like range queries, nearest neighbor searches, or spatial queries to find properties based on location, price, area, etc.
•	Utilize sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quick sort) to order search results based on user preferences.
•	Implement data structures like priority queues or heaps for ranking and displaying top results.
•	Handle multi-criteria searches by combining multiple filters and conditions.
•	Integrate with external APIs or databases to fetch property data and make real-time updates.
•	Provide a user interface for entering search criteria, displaying results, and interacting with property details.
•	Implement caching or indexing techniques for improving search performance on large datasets.
